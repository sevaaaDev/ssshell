## problem
loop thru command
dont break but continue instead

while commands exist; do
    exec(command)
// if dont exec next, continue
done

if u want to make && || as command, find a way to able to continue bcs u gonna exec that anyway

command = ls , && , echo
when exec the &&, find a way to control the flow
